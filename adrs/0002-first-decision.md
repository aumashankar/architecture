## Context and Problem Statement

Our application needs to scale dynamically to meet fluctuating demand and accelerate development cycles. A monolithic architecture could limit our ability to scale components independently and make frequent, isolated updates.

## Decision Drivers

- Scalability
- Flexibility
- Development speed

## Considered Options

- Monolithic Architecture
- Microservices Architecture
- Serverless Architecture

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Microservices Architecture", because it provides the scalability and flexibility we need. It allows individual services to scale based on demand, and teams can develop, deploy, and scale their services independently.

### Positive Consequences

- Improved scalability
- Faster development cycles
- Flexibility in technology stack choices for different services

### Negative Consequences

- Increased complexity in managing services
- Potential for increased latency between service calls
- Need for sophisticated monitoring and error handling
